# -HOME-_TECHNICIAN-_AND_SERVICES
Home Services And technician As in lockdown we have seen that if we need any services we need to think a lot before going out of house.

During those time we have seen if we need to go for a haircut we need to think twice or thrice before going so some company came up with idea to provide salon at home services. 

In this we need to book a slot and that company will send their hairstylist and with proper protocol he will do his work. 

In this project I include 3 services which is basic requirement for home services so that user can book there slot and user detail will automatically fill into database

and based on that company will send their technician. 

IN THIS PROJECT I HAVE USE THREE TECHNOLOGY THOSE ARE:

1) Java Programming 

2) Sql (structure query language) 

3) JDBC(java database connectivity) 

4) Eclipse software
